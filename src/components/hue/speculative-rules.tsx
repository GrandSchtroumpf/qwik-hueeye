   * A string providing a hint to the browser as to how eagerly it should prefetch/prerender link targets in order to balance performance advantages against resource overheads.
   * - **immediat**: The author thinks the link is very likely to be followed, and/or the document may take significant time to fetch. Prefetch/prerender should start as soon as possible, subject only to considerations such as user preferences and resource limits.
   * - **eager**: The author wants to prefetch/prerender a large number of navigations, as early as possible. Prefetch/prerender should start on any slight suggestion that a link may be followed. For example, the user could move their mouse cursor towards the link, hover/focus it for a moment, or pause scrolling with the link in a prominent place.
   * - **moderate**: The author is looking for a balance between eager and conservative. Prefetch/prerender should start when there is a reasonable suggestion that the user will follow a link in the near future. For example, the user could scroll a link into the viewport and hover/focus it for some time.
   * - **conservative**: The author wishes to get some benefit from speculative loading with a fairly small tradeoff of resources. Prefetch/prerender should start only when the user is starting to click on the link, for example on mousedown or pointerdown.
   * 
   * If "eagerness" is not explicitly specified, list ("urls") rules default to immediate and document ("where") rules default to conservative. The browser takes this hint into consideration along with its own heuristics, so it may select a link that the author has hinted as less eager than another, if the less eager candidate is considered a better choice.
